How do I
1. create a file in which the user can see the number of characters equal to the number of letters in 
the word?

2. handle invalid guesses by displaying a message and having the user enter a different guess. 
Invalid guesses don't count against the guess count?

3. make it so that at the beginning of the game, the number of guesses remaining should be visible?
