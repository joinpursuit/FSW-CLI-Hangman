Theo's Questions:

1. How do I get math.random to work? It seems to not be generating the random word?

2. What is the typical standard to organzing your code in a game such as this?  Should the functions come before the game controls, etc? I had issues with orgazing the code in a way that made logical sense.

3. This might go back to #1 (if the word isn't generating then there is no word to guess). But when you try to play the game, and enter a guess it just says "try again" no matter what I type. If this because I have set that portion of the game loop up wrong, or is it because the word isn't generating?
